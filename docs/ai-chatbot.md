## Sample Conversations

### Example 1: Leave Balance

**You:** How many sick leave days do I have?

**AI:** Employees are entitled to 14 days of sick leave per year. To check your remaining balance, go to Leave > My Balance. Sick leave up to 2 days doesn't require a medical certificate, but for 3 or more consecutive days, you'll need to submit an MC.

### Example 2: CPF Rates

**You:** What are the CPF rates?

**AI:** For employees aged 55 and below:
- Employee contribution: 20%
- Employer contribution: 17%
- Total: 37%

The monthly ordinary wage ceiling is $8,000. Contributions are calculated on wages up to this ceiling.
