# Summary: 23 Feb 2026

**Status**: All executed and deployed (in `c0188a0` on main)

## Plans Executed

### QA Testing & E2E Expansion
- Full QA pass against production. Verified DB state (test accounts, leave balances, salary info, expense categories).
- Added `loginAsStaff2` helper, wrote 4 new Playwright test files (payroll, calendar, multi-staff, view toggle).
- Expanded from 13 → 39 e2e tests, all passing.

### E2E NetworkIdle Fix
- Replaced all 14 `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` calls with content-based waits (`toContainText`, `waitForSelector`).
- Root cause: persistent HMR WebSocket + chat widget caused infinite hangs.

### Manual Testing Plan
- Defined 81 manual test cases across 10 modules as a reference checklist.
- Documented 10 known pre-existing issues as "document, don't fix."

### Mobile UI Polish (Initial)
- Fixed calendar dark theme colors, converted 3 list tables (leave, expenses, payroll) to card layouts on mobile.
- Pure CSS/layout changes, no logic or API changes.

## Key Debugging Discoveries
- `networkidle` hangs due to HMR WebSocket — use targeted content waits instead
- Calendar component had light theme colors leaking through
