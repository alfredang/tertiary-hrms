## What Was Done This Session

### 1. Test Account Reactivation
- Ran `scripts/reactivate-test-accounts.ts` to set all 3 test accounts (admin@, staff@, staff2@) back to ACTIVE status
- Purpose: enable mobile testing with test accounts

### 2. Bug Fix: Sign-Out Button Missing (`8effd6d`)

**Problem**: The user avatar dropdown (with Sign out, Profile, Settings) was completely missing from the header. The sidebar UserNav was also hidden.

**Root cause**: `SKIP_AUTH=true` in `.env` bypasses middleware auth and the dashboard layout hardcodes `role = "ADMIN"`. But there's no actual client-side session (especially in Incognito mode). Both `header.tsx` and `user-nav.tsx` gated their rendering on `session?.user` from `useSession()`, which returned null — hiding the entire user dropdown.

**Fix**:
- **Dashboard layout** (`layout.tsx`) — resolves user info server-side: uses `session?.user?.name` if available, otherwise queries DB for admin test account when SKIP_AUTH is on
- **Header** — accepts `fallbackName`/`fallbackEmail` props, uses them when client session is null. Dropdown always renders (no more `session?.user &&` gate)
- **UserNav** — same pattern: accepts fallback props, removed `if (!session?.user) return null` early return
- **MobileSidebar** — passes fallback props through to UserNav

**Files changed**:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — added prisma import, user info resolution, fallback props
- `src/components/layout/header.tsx` — added fallbackName/Email props, displayName/Email vars, always-render dropdown
- `src/components/layout/mobile-sidebar.tsx` — added MobileSidebarProps interface, pass-through props
- `src/components/layout/user-nav.tsx` — added UserNavProps interface, removed null guard, display vars

## Uncommitted Changes

| File | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `android/app/capacitor.build.gradle` | Modified | Capacitor plugin config (from Google Auth install) |
| `android/capacitor.settings.gradle` | Modified | Capacitor plugin config |
| `ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift` | Modified | iOS SPM dependency update |
| `package-lock.json` | Modified | Lock file from Google Auth plugin |
| `android/.idea/` | Untracked | Android Studio IDE files (should be gitignored) |

These are all Capacitor/native config changes from the Google Auth plugin install — not source code changes.

---

## Validation Status

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Dev server | Running on localhost:3000 |
| Sign-out button | Visible with "TEST ADMIN" name in SKIP_AUTH mode |
| `tsc --noEmit` | Not run this session |
| `npm run test` | Not run this session |
| E2E | Not run this session |

## Branch Status

`feat/mobile-google-auth` is **4 commits ahead of `main`** with:
1. Native Google Sign-In for Capacitor (Orion)
2. Privacy policy page (Orion)
3. Privacy policy middleware + login link (Orion)
4. Sign-out button fix (Claude)

**Not yet merged to main** — needs review/merge before Coolify deploys.

---

## Remaining / Next Steps

### Ready to Go
- [ ] Add `android/.idea/` to `.gitignore` (IDE files shouldn't be tracked)
- [ ] Commit remaining Capacitor config changes (gradle, SPM, package-lock)
- [ ] Run `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run test` to validate
- [ ] Merge `feat/mobile-google-auth` → `main` and push (triggers Coolify deploy)
- [ ] Run `TEST_ENV=production npx playwright test` after deploy

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test native Google Sign-In on Android (needs Google OAuth Client ID with SHA-1)
- [ ] Test native Google Sign-In on iOS (needs Bundle ID configured)
- [ ] Test sign-out flow on mobile WebView
- [ ] Test privacy policy page accessibility

### Blocked on Boss
- [ ] Google OAuth Client IDs for Android/iOS (SHA-1 and Bundle ID)
- [ ] UploadThing token (form migration)
- [ ] Resend API key (email notifications)
- [ ] Chat widget API key
- [ ] Test account deactivation go-ahead

### Low Priority
- [ ] Fix `isAdmin` inconsistency across files
- [ ] Manual-test DatePicker on desktop and mobile

---

## Next Session Should

1. Run validation (`tsc --noEmit`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`)
2. Commit Capacitor config changes + add `android/.idea/` to gitignore
3. Merge branch to main and push for Coolify deploy
4. Run e2e against production after deploy
5. If boss provides Google OAuth Client IDs → test native mobile sign-in
6. If no keys → address remaining low-priority items or start next feature
